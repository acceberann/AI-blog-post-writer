**AI Blog Post Writing Tool: Project Scope Document**

### 1. Project Overview
This AI Blog Post Writing Tool aims to guide users through creating fully drafted blog posts based on their keywords. It leverages OpenAI's API to generate outlines, drafts, and refine content through a step-by-step wizard-style UI. The goal is to create an intuitive, user-friendly process that delivers value by simplifying blog creation with the power of AI, ultimately leading to a subscription-based SaaS product.

### 2. Component Breakdown
#### Frontend Components
- **Wizard.js**: Acts as the main container for the entire step-by-step process. It controls navigation between different components representing each stage of blog post generation.
  - **KeywordSelection.js**: Handles input of the initial keyword/topic from the user to begin the blog creation process.
  - **OutlineGeneration.js**: Sends the user's keyword to the backend to generate an outline using the OpenAI API and displays it for user review.
  - **BrandVoiceCheck.js**: Either checks for an existing brand voice profile or guides the user through creating one if it doesnâ€™t exist.
  - **BlogDraftGeneration.js**: Uses the generated outline and brand voice profile to produce the initial draft of the blog post.
  - **HumanReview.js**: Displays the draft for user feedback, allowing them to make changes or approve the draft.
  - **FinalReview.js**: A stage where the user can give final approval to the content, ensuring it meets their expectations.
  - **PublishAndExport.js**: Finalizes the content, allowing users to download it or publish it to a connected platform.

#### Backend
- **index.js**: Contains the backend server logic. Manages requests and responses for generating outlines, creating brand voice profiles, and handling user inputs.
  - **Endpoints**: Detailed below.

### 3. File Structure and Responsibilities
- **/frontend**: Contains all client-side components and CSS files.
  - **Wizard directory**: Holds individual components for each step in the wizard UI.
  - **App.js**: Serves as the entry point for rendering the main Wizard component.
  - **index.css**: Manages the styles for the entire application.
- **/backend/index.js**: The main backend server file. It configures the OpenAI API, handles all API endpoints, manages CORS, and processes the blog-related tasks.

### 4. Endpoints and Functionality
- **/generate-outline**:
  - **Request**: `POST` with `topic` in the body.
  - **Response**: Returns a generated outline for the given topic.
  - **Confirmed in Postman**: Works successfully with the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, returns structured outlines.
- **/create-brand-voice**:
  - **Request**: Handles multiple stages of creating a brand voice profile based on user responses.
  - **Response**: Either sends the next question or confirms that the profile is complete.
  - **Confirmed in Postman**: Works for collecting and confirming user inputs.

### 5. OpenAI API Settings
- **Version**: `openai@4.67.3`.
- **Configuration**:
  - **Key Setup**: Utilizes `dotenv` to load the OpenAI API key from environment variables.
  - **API Methods**: Uses `createChatCompletion` to interact with the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for generating content.
  - **Max Tokens**: Typically set to `300` to ensure a detailed response that remains within response length limits.
- **Integration Points**: Called within the `/generate-outline` and draft generation endpoints.

### 6. CORS Setup
- **Library Used**: `cors`.
- **Configuration**: CORS enabled for all routes (`app.use(cors())`). This allows requests from the frontend to the backend server running on different ports during local development.
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Only allow CORS in development, and tighten these settings in production.
  - Specify trusted origins to limit cross-origin access when the app is deployed.

### 7. Security Measures
- **Input Sanitization**: Uses `DOMPurify` in the frontend to sanitize user inputs and prevent HTML injection before sending them to the backend.
- **API Interaction**:
  - Inputs are verified before being sent to OpenAI to avoid passing unintended data.
  - Implemented backend checks to ensure that all inputs are correctly formatted and contain no harmful content.
- **Rate Limiting**: Planned implementation of rate limiting on the backend to prevent abuse of the OpenAI API endpoints.

### 8. User Flow
1. **Keyword Selection**: User provides a keyword to begin blog creation.
   - Input is sanitized and then passed to the backend.
2. **Outline Generation**: Backend uses OpenAI to generate a detailed outline.
   - User reviews the outline and provides feedback or approval.
3. **Brand Voice Profile**: System checks if a brand voice profile exists.
   - If not, prompts the user with a series of questions to create one.
4. **Draft Generation**: Uses the outline and brand voice profile to create the first blog draft.
5. **Human Review**: User reviews the draft, making edits or approving.
6. **Final Review**: User provides final approval of the content.
7. **Publish & Export**: User can download, publish, or export the content for their purposes.

### Next Steps
- **Enhance Documentation**: Make sure each developer (including myself) references this document for every code addition or change to ensure alignment.
- **Refine Components**: Use this document to identify any components that need refactoring or changes to match the new user flow.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Use the detailed endpoints and settings here to verify that each part of the flow is functioning as intended, using Postman and console logs effectively.
